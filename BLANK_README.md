<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Well, you know what Paul said right, "The best way to learn is to do". So in my quest to understand the intricacies of the super powerful and super fast (tested here) WASM, I decided to code.

I wanted to code something cool, nothing's cooler than video games, and the coolest game ever created was Pong.

Therefore naturally broke out the ol' Commodore 64 and wrote the code in Cpp, compiled using Emscripten and hosted through Python.
